# FitnessStudy
 
 A chain of fitness business requests a model to categorice their clients and find potential clients to unsubscribe. 

 Throught the project we reached the following results: 

 * The Logistic Regression model is the mos optimal model for the prediction of possible users to unsubscribe.
 * For groups 0 and 2 its users are more likely to cancel.
 * For groups 1 and 4 their users are more loyal.
 * Group 3 seems to be the balanced group between cancellations and permanence although it has a slight tendency to cancellations. 
 
 All this is due to the fact that much of the following: 
 
 * For the most loyal groups, their contracts are longer, they tend to be among the oldest groups of people in the sample, they tend to participate in group sessions and are the longest-lived in the gym. 
 
 * The groups with the highest probability of cancellations tend to have shorter contracts (1 month, 3 months), do not tend to come from a partner company, do not participate as much in group sessions and tend to cancel after 2 months.
 
 To this end, the following recommendations are suggested: 
 
 * Promote longer contract plans.
 * Offer rewards to encourage users to participate in group sessions. 
 * The groups of people who tend to be most loyal are people over 28 years old, focus advertising campaigns to this segment of people.
